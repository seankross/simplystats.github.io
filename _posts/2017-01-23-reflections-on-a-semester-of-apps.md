Last fall Jeff, [John Muschelli](https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat), and I 
co-taught a course called Advanced Data Science where we sucessfully tested a
hypothesis we had about the graduate students in the department of biostatistics
here at Johns Hopkins. We're lucky to have access to some of the best
biostatisticians in training, and that training incudes a robust amount of
instruction in *research programming* - using computational tools to ask and
answer questions about the world. Most of the research programming
